# Silent-Auction-Program---Python
I created a silent auction program to allow people bid for projects in secret and allow the organization select the winning bid after comprehensive evaluation of all bids individually.

## Steps Taken:
* Create a greeting.
* Create an empty dictionary which will help store the bid amounts and their corresponding auctioneers.
* Create a function to add each bid and the corrsponding auctioneer into our dictionary ; auc_dict.
* Create a function to display the winning bid.
* Create a while loop to allow the program take infinite number of bids.
